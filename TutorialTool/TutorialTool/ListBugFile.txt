1. Fixed: Bug when change action sequence type from ActionCocos2d to ActionMoving, action type is null.
2. Fixed: When user changes an object's properties while editing its name, the program will have unusual behavior (even crashes)
3. Fixed: When create a new object while rotate, sometimes the object will return back to the original state.
4. Fixed: If the sprite is too wide or too high, when rotating its frame could cover the green dot used for rotating, making the rotate click event unusable.
5. If the user deletes a storyboard with actions in it, the next time the user creates a new storyboard, it will have the deleted storyboard's actions.
6. Fixed: Particle sometimes crashes when user redraws tutorial scene using function from NSWindow (due to different thread call) (Fixed by changing cocos2d's config CC_DIRECTOR_MAC_THREAD into CC_MAC_USE_MAIN_THREAD, the default config was CC_MAC_USE_DISPLAY_LINK_THREAD)
7. Fixed : While config an action sequence, if user creates a new action sequence and chooses a different action sequence type, then the app will crash.
8. Fixed: While create many actions in a sequence, the animation will lose all its animation frames. 
9. Bug when create new storyboard anymore
